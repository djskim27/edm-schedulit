# ScheduLIT

Atlanta has become a booming scene for the Electronic Dance Music industry! Being a huge fan of dubstep, house, and trap myself, I wanted to build a platform that allowed users to keep track of every EDM event in the world! Because so many different events are advertised and sold on different platforms (Eventbrite, Tickmaster,etc), it has become extremely tedious to keep up with EVERY single show. In order to alleviate this problem, I attempted to build ScheduLIT!

This MERN CRUD app is a basic model for how I (as a frequent EDM event attendant) would want to keep track of AND schedule all EDM events of personal interest. On the homepage, users can see several events listed in order of date and add them to their personal event schedule. ScheduLIT also has Soundcloud and Youtube links for specific DJs/artists for users to help influence themselves in adding shows!
